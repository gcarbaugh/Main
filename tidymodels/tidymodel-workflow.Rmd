There are several packages in Tidymodels designed to simplify workflow.


recipes: For data preprocessing and feature engineering.
parsnip: A unified interface for modeling.
rsample: Tools for resampling and data splitting.
dials: Parameter tuning objects.
tune: Hyperparameter tuning.
yardstick: Performance metrics.
workflows: Pipeline creation.
broom: Tidying model outputs.


```{r}

gam_model <- parsnip::gen_additive_mod() %>% 
  parsnip::set_engine('mgcv') %>% 
  parsnip::set_mode("regression") %>% 
  parsnip::set_

rec <- recipes::recipe(formula = carat ~., data = diamonds) %>% 
  recipes::step_ordinalscore(all_factor_predictors())

gam_wf <- workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(rec) %>% 
  add_model(gam_model) %>% 
  fit(data = diamonds)
